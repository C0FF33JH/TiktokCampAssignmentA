Hi there, thank you for playing Pop The Pirate, a hangman themed game! To start, simply click on LaunchPopThePirate. It should appear like this:

You have to guess the sea creature to save Benny the pirate who is trapped in a barrel, by guessing the letters that make up the name of the sea creature! Be careful though, guessing the wrong letter will cause a sword to pushed into the barrel. Up to six swords will pushed into the barrel before Benny the pirate pops out of it and falls into the sea!

You can always reset the game by clicking the reset button, this will generate another mystery sea creature to be guessed.
